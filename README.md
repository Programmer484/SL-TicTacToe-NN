# SL-TicTacToe-NN
Neural network for TicTacToe trained with supervised learning.
* To experiment with the training process, run 2_train_net.py
* To play against the model, or have different nets play against each other, run 3_test_net.py

Exactly what do I use it for?

_Writing code for simple logic and functions_:

 *  Training loop outline
 * Tic-tac-toe board outcome check
 * Save training data to a pickle file
 *  Generate sample of board positions along with their MCTS move probabilities
 
_Readability_: 

 * Documenting functions
 * Suggesting better variable/function/file names
 * Generating shorter code to achieve the same functionality

Essentially I come up with the high level plan, and I prompt AI for each small piece of logic.
