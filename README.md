# SL-TicTacToe-NN
Neural network for TicTacToe trained with supervised learning


Acknowledgements:
This project includes code generated with the assistance of Github copilot. 
Exactly what do I use it for? 
Writing code for simple logic and functions:
 - training loop outline
 - tic-tac-toe board outcome check
 - save training data to a pickle file
 - generate sample of board positions along with their MCTS move probabilities
Readability: 
 - Documenting functions
 - Suggesting better variable/function/file names,
 - Generating shorter code to achieve the same functionality

Essentially I come up with the high level plan, and I prompt AI for each small piece of logic.
